Information for the block chain.

Blocks consist of four fundamental pieces of data.

Blocks -
1. Timestamp -- To record when they were created. Created with a Date object
2. LastHash -- Hash of the block that came before it. Unique value for a block.
3. Hash for the current block, based on the current blocks own data.
4. The data to store inside the block.

A Genesis block is needed to act as the very first block in the blockchain.

Hash -
The hash uses an amalgamation of timestamp, lastHash, and stored data to compute
its value. SHA-256 is used for hashing as it strikes a balance between security
and performance. The hash is used for block validation.

Proof -
Any system can be a contributor so long as they have a running updated copy of the
blockchain, and to the Proof of Work needed to verify and add a block to the chain.

This block chain relies on the proof of work algorithm.
