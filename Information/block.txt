Information for the block chain.

Blocks consist of four fundamental pieces of data.

1. Timestamp -- To record when they were created. Created with a Date object
2. LastHash -- Hash of the block that came before it. Unique value for a block.
3. Hash for the current block, based on the current blocks own data.
4. The data to store inside the block.

A Genesis block is needed to act as the very first block in the blockchain.
